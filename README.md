# Optimal-Pathfinding-Engine-on-2D-Grid-Maps
A C-based pathfinding engine for 2D grid maps that calculates minimum-cost paths with complex altitude constraints and bidirectional teleportation logic. It implements Dijkstra-based graph traversal and validates node properties using Fibonacci sequence algorithms to optimize movement efficiency.
